# noteScrape
In one sweep download and save all your university or school notes

## notes I will be scraping personally
* DCU Moodle/Loop notes (pdf's, etc) (loop.dcu.ie)

## The main issues/parts of the program to be dealt with are:
* logging onto the educational platform with the notes (since it's likely exclusive for the educational institution's students)
* navigating the platform/website, finding the needed content (likely across multiple pages)
* downloading/saving the actual notes (pdf, other file type)
